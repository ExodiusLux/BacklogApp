# BacklogApp
Problem Solving: Does your app solve a clear problem?
  My app tackles the issues of havings lots of TV shows and Movies but either forgetting what exactly you wanted to watch
  or what episode you last left on so the app will track all of that for you
  
Correctness: Does your app solve the problem effectively?
  My app tackles it effectively by using a databse to store Users lists of TV Shows/Movies and store what episode they last left on

Implementation: Have you implemented the running version that can be demo to the class?
  I have implemented the running version and demonstrated it to the class

Completeness: How complete is your implementation compared with your proposed idea and plan? In other words, how complete is your app in terms of functions and features?
  My implementation is fairly the same as my initially proposed idea albeit with some changes on UI and missing some 
  notification functionality but the main core of the idea still remains
  
UI & UX: What is the overall quality of your UI? How is the overall user experience (e.g., user
navigation, workflow, etc.)?
  The User experience is very simple and streamlined albeit the UI can be classified as simplisitic as I focused more on the functionality of the
  app over the looks 
  
Complexity: The overall complexity of your app in terms of architecture, UI, components, and
logic. Of course, the number of members in your team will be considered.
  It is fairly complex haing to deal with constant connection to both the tmdb api as well as Firebase Realtime databse to take care of the listing and
  searching of items as well as the complexity of storing those items, saving information like next episode to watch and being able to display the 
  overview of that episode
  
Usability: Is the app ready to be used by the target public users? Or is it something just for
your or your team to try with the limited naive inputs?
  It should be ready to be used by target public users the only issue I can see arising is too many users using it at once causing Firebase to be upset with
  so many simultanrous connections
  
Clean Code: Is your code clean and organized? Have you used GitHub to manage all the code? Have you checked in all the code with a README file?
  The code I believe is fairly organized but can be long winded due to multiple methods, containers contained inside each other
  
Publishing: Have you published the project in the official stores?
  The app is already published on the store under the name "Backlog"
